ES2016 was the first ECMAScript version that was designed according to the TC39 process.

Once a feature is reached to stage4, it runs all test case in [Test262](https://github.com/tc39/test262/blob/master/INTERPRETING.md), so you can use it safely. But even then, you should still check if the device environment you use supports it. You can see all the [finished feature](https://github.com/tc39/proposals/blob/master/finished-proposals.md) and [other proposals](https://github.com/tc39/proposals) in the official list.
